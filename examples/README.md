# README

This repository contains some examples of type-level TOSCA which can be parsed using the parser. Templates for three applications are included:



- A template inspired from a Video Surveillance application, in which audio and video is being streamed from microphones and cameras, and is being processed to gain video access when an incident is reported

- A template inspired from an Audio/Image processing service, which allows monochrome pictures to be automatically colorized and melodies to be split to a number of independent tracks (e.g reflecting the vocals, the bass line etc.)

- A template inspired from a Sentiment analysis service, which allows multiple workers ('Analyzers') to be spawned in order to perform parallel sentiment analysis on a text corpus
